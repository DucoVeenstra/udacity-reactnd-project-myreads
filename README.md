# My Bookshelf
"My Bookshelf" is a react application,for Udacity's React Nanodegree first project assignment, "MyReads". Users will be able to search books via the provided api of udacity. These books can be added to three provided bookshelfs 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', 'Read' and 'None'. As extra feature I added the star-rating of each book that is registered. The second extra feature is a function to clear a bookshelf, in stead of delete each book from a shelf.
